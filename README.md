# Digital-Twin-based-system-for-pregnancy-risk-prevention-and-perinatal-care
This repository hosts the development of a Perinatal Digital Twin System, a cutting-edge solution for improving maternal health and managing risks during pregnancy. The project combines digital twin technology with machine learning to monitor maternal and fetal health, predict complications, and enhance perinatal care.
All the datasets were found in Kaggle and the datasets with patient-related information are synthetic (should be explained below its generation). 

The main objectives of the proyect are the stated: 
1. Early Detection: Identify and quantify risks of severe complications during pregnancy, in particular, we have focused on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Preeclampsia risk detection. 
2. Continuous Monitoring: Track maternal and fetal health throughout gestation using wearable devices, combined with the encounter data. 
3. Personalized Treatment: Deliver tailored recommendations based on the patientâ€™s real-time data and medical history.
4. Improved Outcomes: Enhance the quality of care for mothers and their babies, minimizing risks and improving patient experiences.
